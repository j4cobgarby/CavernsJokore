This folder is for the most recent successful release
build. The most recent build can also be found at the
directory:
	CavernsJokore/src/Roguelike/bin/Release
In this directory, the other files which building fr-
om visual studio generates can be found.

However this won't necessarily be the latest approved
build.

You should be able to run it by just double clicking
Roguelike.exe, however if this doesn't work I'd sugg-
est building it yourself from the source.

## Building from source (If you can't run the EXE)

To do this, open up CavernsJokore/src/Roguelike.sln
in Visual Studio, or Xamarin should work too.
If you've used any of these before, you should know
how to build in them. For Visual Studio, you just look
at the top and press the Start button, next to a green
triangle.
I haven't used Xamarin in a while, but I assume that
it would be rather similar to this process.
