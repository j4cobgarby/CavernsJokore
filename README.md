### A roguelike written in C# for Windows, without using Curses, or any additional C# libraries!

## Installation
 1. Clone the repository to your computer, anywhere!
 2. Have a computer running Windows.
 3. Open the project file in Visual Studio. I've used Visual Studio 2015, but it should work in others.
 4. That's it!
 
## Usage
Right now, there isn't a downloadable `.exe`. However, you can easily build it yourself from Visual Studio! I would suggest this.
It does **not** work on any operating system besides Windows.

If you are in this sub-heading for any reason besides how to use the actual `.exe`, you probably want to know how to play! Well, **at the time of writing, it's not playable**. I mean, you *technically* can play it, but it's not particularly exciting.

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request!
